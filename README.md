### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. The goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. By utilizing data cleaning, SQL queries, and visualization techniques 

---

### Data Source
A customer dataset containing information about regions, subscription types, start and end dates, revenue, and subscription status (active or canceled)[[Customer Data.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17507351/Customer.Data.csv)
]

### Tools Used
1. Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning (removing duplicates) and summarizing the data using pivot tables.
2. SQL Server: Performed data analysis and created views for generating insights.
3. Power BI: Used to visualize the findings through interactive dashboards.

---

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
1.	Duplicate Removal: Removed duplicate customer entries to ensure data quality and integrity.

  ### SQL Queries for Analysis
1. Total Sales for Each Product Category 
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW_LITA_SALES_CAPSTONE_PROJECT
AS
SELECT Product,SUM(Quantity) as Total_Sales
FROM [dbo].[Sales Data]
GROUP BY Product
```
2. Number of Sales Transactions in Each Region
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW2_LITA_SALES_CAPSTONE_PROJECT AS
SELECT Region, SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Sales
FROM [dbo].[Sales Data]
GROUP BY Region;
```
3. Highest-Selling Product by Total Sales Value
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW3_LITA_SALES_CAPSTONE_PROJECT AS
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Sales
FROM [dbo].[Sales Data]
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;
```
4. Total Revenue Per Product
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW4_LITA_SALES_CAPSTONE_PROJECT AS
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS Total_Revenue
FROM [dbo].[Sales Data]
GROUP BY Product;
```
5. Monthly Sales Totals for the Current Year (2024)
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW5_LITA_SALES_CAPSTONE_PROJECT AS
SELECT OrderMonth, SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Sales
FROM [dbo].[Sales Data]
WHERE OrderYear = 2024
GROUP BY OrderMonth;
```
6. Top 5 Customers by Total Purchase Amount
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW6_LITA_SALES_CAPSTONE_PROJECT AS
SELECT TOP 5 Customer_Id, SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Purchase
FROM [dbo].[Sales Data]
GROUP BY Customer_Id
ORDER BY Total_Purchase DESC;
```
7. Percentage of Total Sales Contributed by Each Region
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW7_LITA_SALES_CAPSTONE_PROJECT AS
SELECT Region, SUM(Revenue) / SUM(Quantity) * 0.1 AS Percentage_of_Total_Sales
FROM [dbo].[Sales Data]
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Percentage_of_Total_Sales;
```
8. Products with No Sales in the Last Quarter
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW8_LITA_SALES_CAPSTONE_PROJECT AS
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Sales
FROM [dbo].[Sales Data]
WHERE MONTH(OrderDate) BETWEEN 10 AND 12
```
