### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. The goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. By utilizing data cleaning, SQL queries, and visualization techniques 

---

### Data Source
A customer dataset containing information about regions, subscription types, start and end dates, revenue, and subscription status (active or canceled)[[Download Dataset](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17507351/Customer.Data.csv)
]

---

### Tools Used
1. Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning (removing duplicates) and summarizing the data using pivot tables.
2. SQL Server: Performed data analysis and created views for generating insights.
3. Power BI: Used to visualize the findings through interactive dashboards.

---

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
1.	Duplicate Removal: Removed duplicate customer entries to ensure data quality and integrity.

### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

1. 	Regional Analysis: Identified regions with the highest number of customers and cancellations.
2. Subscription Type Analysis: Analyzed the popularity and total revenue generated by each subscription type.
3. Duration Analysis: Evaluated the average duration of subscriptions and identified long-term subscribers.
4. Customer Trends: Observed trends in customer cancellations within the first six months.

---

  ### SQL Queries Analysis
1. 	Total Number of Customers by Region
   ```sql
CREATE VIEW VW1_LITAcustomer AS
SELECT Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS Total_No_of_Customers
FROM [dbo].[Customer Data]
GROUP BY Region
```
2. 	Most Popular Subscription Type
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW2_LITAcustomer AS
SELECT SubscriptionType, COUNT(CustomerID) AS NO_Of_Customers
FROM [dbo].[Customer Data]
GROUP BY SubscriptionType

```
3.	Customers Who Canceled Within 6 Months
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW3_LITAcustomer AS
SELECT CustomerName, Canceled, SubscriptionStart
FROM [dbo].[Customer Data]
WHERE Canceled = 0 AND MONTH(SubscriptionStart) <= 6

```
4. 	Average Subscription Duration
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW4_LITAcustomer AS
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID) AS All_Customers, AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd)) AS Average_Subscription_Duration
FROM [dbo].[Customer Data]
WHERE SubscriptionEnd IS NOT NULL

```
5.	Customers with Subscriptions Longer than 12 Months
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW5_LITAcustomer AS
SELECT CustomerName, SubscriptionType, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd
FROM [dbo].[Customer Data]
WHERE DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) >= 12

```
6. Total Revenue by Subscription Type
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW6_LITAcustomer AS
SELECT SubscriptionType, SUM(Revenue) AS Total_Revenue
FROM [dbo].[Customer Data]
GROUP BY SubscriptionType

```
7. 	Top 3 Regions by Subscription Cancellations
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW7_LITAcustomer AS
SELECT TOP 3 Region, COUNT(Canceled) AS Cancellations
FROM [dbo].[Customer Data]
WHERE Canceled = 1
GROUP BY Region

```
8. Total Active and Canceled Subscriptions:
```sql
CREATE VIEW VW8_LITAcustomer AS
SELECT
SUM(CASE WHEN Canceled = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ActiveSubscriptions,
SUM(CASE WHEN Canceled = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS CanceledSubscriptions
FROM [dbo].[Customer Data]
```
